              A guided workshop that gradually trains safe blindfold dancing — then moves into a long silent
              block where the experience becomes deep, minimal, and focused.

              Returning to the Silent Block is <b>usually possible</b>, but may be declined if safety or

            <ul class="qaList">
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: When and where is it?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Saturday 21 February 2026, Amsterdam. Time window is approximately 11:00–20:00, plus a closing debrief and grounding. The exact venue/address will be shared with confirmed participants only, no later than 15 February 2026.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Why is the venue shared only with confirmed participants?</span><span class="qa-a">A: For participant safety and because the final venue is still being selected to optimize floor quality, space, ventilation, and location.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: How long is the workshop and how is it structured?</span><span class="qa-a">A: About 6 hours total, split into two ~3-hour sections:</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>Preparation & training (signals, boundaries, safe blindfold dancing)</li>
                  <li>The 3-hour Silent Blindfold Block (no participant talking; safety exceptions exist), followed by a debrief/grounding.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is there a break?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes—one main break between the two sections. The first part is also more flexible for quick step-outs if needed.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Who is this workshop for?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Primarily for the Zouk community (improver+). It can be challenging for dancers below intermediate. Trusted, highly skilled dancers from other couple dances may be invited case-by-case.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I join if I’ve never danced blindfolded?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. The first part includes gradual accommodation and safety training. If you have a known strong fear of darkness or blindfolding, this workshop may not be suitable.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is it okay if I’m anxious about blindfolding?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Many people are. Safety measures, clear rules, and instructed team are present to support you. If unexpected anxiety arises during the workshop, the team will help.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is it okay if I know in advance I can’t stay blindfolded for 3 hours?</span><span class="qa-a">A: If you already know you won’t be able to stay in the Silent Block for the full duration, it’s recommended not to join.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is it invitation-only?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. No one can buy a ticket without an invitation.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What is the registration flow?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Get invited → fill the registration form → pay → confirmed → can invite others. Invitations are reviewed to maintain safety, trust, and role parity.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Do I need to bring ID?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. Please bring a government-issued ID (passport/driver license) that matches the registration name. For container safety, we may ask to check it to confirm the right person is entering.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can organizers decline an invite?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. Organizers may decline when necessary (safety, trust, role parity, or container integrity). Unusual cases are handled individually.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is there an age limit?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes—18+ only.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I register solo?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. Solo registration is welcome.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I register with a partner?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. Add a note about your partner in the registration form; we will try to add you both if spots allow, or tell you otherwise.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Will there be partner rotation?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes—rotation is frequent and part of the format, including moments where you may not know who you’re dancing with.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I opt out of rotation?</span><span class="qa-a">A: No. Rotation is integral to the workshop design.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is there any way to avoid dancing with a specific person?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. You can confidentially submit a “do not pair me with X” request for personal reasons—no questions asked. Rotations will be adjusted to satisfy constraints. We still encourage you to try seeing everyone from a fresh perspective in this safe space.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: When should I submit a “do not pair” request?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Preferably as soon as the participant list is published, but it can also be submitted at the venue.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Will my “do not pair” request be confidential?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. It is handled confidentially.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What if multiple “do not pair” requests create rotation issues?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Rotations will be adjusted to satisfy the constraints.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Are roles fixed (Leader/Follower)?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes. The workshop uses fixed Leader/Follower roles for structure and safety, with strict parity.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I switch roles?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Role changes are limited. Some exercises may include brief role swaps when the exercise dictates it, and participants are encouraged to follow the exercise for safety reasons. Exceptions may be allowed case-by-case for highly experienced dancers.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What’s the baseline consent rule?</span><span class="qa-a">A: No intimate touch, no surprises, no testing boundaries. Everything stays within socially appropriate close-embrace partner-dance boundaries.</span></li>

              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What are the safety signals during the Silent Block?</span><span class="qa-a">A: They will be trained in the first section:</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>Partner stop: trained hand squeeze → freeze + give space</li>
                  <li>Call a team member: raise your hand</li>
                  <li>Audible exception: allowed only if absolutely necessary (safety overrides silence)</li>

              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I remove my blindfold in the safe area?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Yes, if necessary. The goal is to support you in the safest way possible.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I return to the Silent Block after removing the blindfold in the safe area?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Usually yes, but the team may decline return for safety or integrity reasons (e.g., medical concern, repeated distress, not following instructions, disruptive behavior, or risk to self/others).</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: If I’m not allowed to return to the Silent Block, what happens?</span><span class="qa-a">A: You can rest in a chill area and may be allowed to join the debrief.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is there a refund if I can’t return to the Silent Block?</span><span class="qa-a">A: No.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What movements are prohibited?</span><span class="qa-a">A: No lifts, no dips, no broad movements, no broad head movements. Head movement is minimal and strictly guided—no fast or large-range head motion.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Is traveling allowed?</span><span class="qa-a">A: In some exercises, yes, when safety allows. It’s taught in the first part and Angels may stop unsafe movement.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Do height/strength differences matter?</span><span class="qa-a">A: The safety rule applies to everyone regardless of size or strength: you must dance safely and respect boundaries. Inside the safety limits, no differences should matter.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Will the music be very loud?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Volume will be curated for comfort; ear protection should not be necessary.</span></li>

              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: What about glasses or contact lenses?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Glasses should be removed for the blindfolded part. Contact lenses are a personal choice; consult organizers if unsure.</span></li>
              <li><span class="qa-q">Q: Can I store valuables safely?</span><span class="qa-a">A: Small valuables may be left with the team members for safekeeping, but participants are advised to bring as little as possible.</span></li>
